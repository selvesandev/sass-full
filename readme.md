### Sass Vs Scss    
##### Sass  
`Syntactically awesome style-sheet` an original language that came up with this extra capabilities
on top of css to write better and reusable codes.   
A bit sorter because you don't use any curly braces and semicolons.  
```
,container
    float:left
    width:100%
    p
      color:#333
```


##### Scss
`Sassy css` also build on top of css. This is more closure to css in syntax basis.

```
.container{
    float:left;
    width:100%;
    p{
        color:#333;
    }
}
```
